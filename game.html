        <h1>Roles</h1>
        <p>The main ar role is to be the back anchor of the team and make sure nothing is out of place by the team. The main ar is usually the igl(in game leader)
            The flex role is a hybrid of ar and sub, a player that can run both, and be the deciding factor of when the player wants to use either one. The flex is the second ar,
             but much faster than the main ar. The flex player will usually be the main vocal point of the team when trying to make play calls. The sub role is similar to the flex,
              but will use a smg more often, but can occassionally run the ar depending on the map. The main sub player is the most aggressive
               player on the team, and will always have the most engagments on the team. The sub player has alot of roles to do depending what the team needs from him.
               Overall, the perfect team will do whatever they need to do to win. Sometimes the main ar will do what a sub player does, but will go back to
               the main main ar objective.
